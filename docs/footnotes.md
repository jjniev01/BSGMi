*1* Built-settlement is differentiated from urban based upon the idea promoted by the feature extraction methods of Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), Global Urban Footprint (GUF), and MAUPP which, through their various methods, attempt to refine the features extracted through Synthetic Apeture Radar (SAR) and multi-band optical data to contain primarily veritcal human-made structures. This attempts to excludes the more traditional remote sensing definition of "urban" which would include impervious surfaces, e.g. roads and runways, and has conotations about the land use and population density colocated at the extracted features.
